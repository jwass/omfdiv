## Build the divisions duckdb database

```
$ poetry run omfdiv builddb
```

This will download the Overture divisions data and create a "divisions.duckdb"
file in the current working directory. This database file will be used by the
UI to dynamically generate the tree.

Note: The data retrieved on S3 is publicly accessible but if you have AWS credentials
in your environment that are expired, this command can fail. Ensure either you have
no keys/credentials set, or the ones that are active have not expired.

## Run the UI

```
$ poetry run omfdiv ui
```
